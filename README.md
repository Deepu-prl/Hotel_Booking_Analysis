#Hotel Booking Analysis
This project analyzes hotel booking data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights about reservations, cancellations, and customer behaviors. The analysis is performed using Python and various data visualization libraries.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to:

Understand booking trends for city and resort hotels.
Compare average daily rates (ADR) between canceled and non-canceled bookings.
Identify seasonal patterns in booking behaviors.
Highlight insights into cancellations by country and other relevant factors.
Key Features
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Removal of null values and outliers.
Conversion of date columns into proper formats for time-series analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualization of booking cancellations by type (city vs. resort hotels).
Analysis of ADR trends over time.
Identification of top countries contributing to cancellations.
Visualizations:

Line charts, bar plots, pie charts, and count plots to present insights.
Highlight seasonal trends and key comparisons.

Visualizations and Insights
Key Findings
Cancellations: The majority of cancellations occur in high-demand seasons, and cancellations are more frequent for city hotels than resort hotels.
Average Daily Rate (ADR): Resort hotels tend to have higher ADR compared to city hotels, especially during the summer months.
Top Countries for Cancellations: The top 10 countries by cancellation count are visualized in a pie chart, showing key contributors.
